# WEATHER APP


This Python application displays the temperature in degrees Celsius after the user inputs a city.

The program uses the requests module to make an API call to OpenWeatherMap, passing the user's city input and API key. The resulting data is then converted to Celsius using the celsius_converter function.

The celsius_converter function takes a Fahrenheit temperature as input and returns the equivalent temperature in Celsius, rounded to one decimal place.

The final output is the weather conditions and temperature in Celsius for the specified city.
